		<h5>Guiding philosophy</h5>

		<p id='quote2'>Birth is not only about making babies. Birth is about making mothersâ€”strong, competent, capable mothers who trust themselves and know their inner strength.<br>~ Barbara Katz Rothman </p>

		<p>My goal is to help empower women and their partners to create the birth experience that they dream of for themselves and for their new baby.  For the baby, the birth environment really does matter.   For the mother, the birth experience sets the stage for motherhood.   Safety, of course, is primary and I believe that the home is most often the healthiest and safest place to be when giving birth.  Hospitals and medical technology are important too, and are most effective when used selectively, and not routinely or universally.</p>

		<p>I see birth as both a beautifully healthy and normal life process and also a sacred rite of passage for both the mom and baby. I aim to treat every birth with that level of reverence.  I see the woman as her own best expert.  Only she can make the decisions that are right for her.  I believe women have a right to autonomy over their own bodies and their own births. It is my job to provide the woman with all the information she needs to make her decisions, to support the decisions she makes and to offer guidance when it is needed.  That approach, combined with both ancient and modern midwifery skills and the availability of modern medicine, make homebirth a safe and potentially very empowering choice for women giving birth today. </p>

		<p>Ultimately, I hope that by tending to birth in a reverent, skillful and loving manner, I will do my part to bring about the culture of wholeness and peace that we all need.</p>
