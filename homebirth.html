		<h5>Homebirth</h5>
		<p>Giving birth at home is a very safe and healthy option for most women. Many women prefer to labor and birth in the comfort and privacy of their own home. Numerous studies have shown that planned homebirth is at least as safe as hospital birth for low-risk women, with far less medical intervention. For the few women who require obstetrical attention, back-up physician and hospital care is readily available.</p>
		<p>One of the cornerstones of an empowered pregnancy and birth is informed choice. I encourage you to do your research. Learn about homebirth and midwifery care. There are many resources on the web to help you.</p>
		<p>There is a substantial amount of scientific evidence on the safety of planned home birth.</p>

		<h5>Here are some of the most prominent studies:</h5>
		<p><a href="####################################################">The 2009 Dutch study:</a> Over half a million planned home births with midwives. Concludes that planned home birth with a midwife is equally as safe as planned hospital birth with a midwife.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmidwives.org/assets/cmaj-homebirth083109.pdf">The 2009 Canadian study:</a> 6,700 planned home births. Concludes that planned home birth with a midwife is safer than planned hospital birth for low-risk women.<br><a href="http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/article/mcmaster-study-finds-home-birth-safe/">Summarized Canadian report.</a></p>
		<p><a href="http://www.berkshirefamilymidwifery.com/downloads/BMJ.pdf">The 2000 North American study:</a> Over 5,000 planned home births. Concludes that planned home birth with a certified professional midwife (CPM) is equally as safe as hospital birth for low-risk women. Women who planned home births also experienced lower rates of medical intervention.</p>

		<h5>Midwifery Care</h5>
		<p>Each birth is unique and each family has different needs. Midwifery care is individualized. You are empowered to learn about the process of pregnancy and birth and to make informed decisions about your care. Your midwife is your partner in this beautiful journey throughout the pregnancy, birth and several weeks postpartum. You can expect to be treated with respect, as the unique family that you are. You get to make the decisions about what kind of prenatal testing (if any) you want, where you want to give birth, who you want to be there, and how you want to do it.</p>
		<p>Pregnancy and childbirth are normal, natural life events which in most situations will proceed beautifully without intervention. The midwife's role is to guide and support the process while allowing the family to create their own experience together.</p>
